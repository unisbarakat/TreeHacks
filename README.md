# Tree Hacks: Subliminal iOS App

A mobile application for those suffering from a mental illness. Many mental health professionals have trouble at times
giving a proper diagnosis or having a full understanding of what their patients go through. The goals of this mobile app 
were the following:

1) Be a platform where the patient can update how they are feeling from a scale of 1-10.

2) Show the user a graph of how their mood has been all day or over the past week, etc..

3) Have the app notify the user every set amount of time to update how they are feeling.

4) Connect Mental Health professionals with patients with the chat feature.

5) Patients can chat with all registered mental health professionals by username.

6) If patient reports being suicidal and having a plan to do so, the app will imediately notify a mental health professional.

7) Connect patients with their mental health professional by making it easier for mental health professionals to monitor their patients.

###*For the purposes of TreeHacks, this app was able to achieve the following:*

1) allow patients and mental health providers to sign up for the service.

2) Fully functional messaging platform between patients and mental health providers.

3) Users are able to update how they are feeling throughout the day.
